## FlexiKit

**FlexiKit is an all around python library for all of your needs, if its from simple additon to full on DLL - GUI management, FlexiKit has you covered.**

### Core-Concepts
 * **1.** **Only pay for what you use** FlexiKit only adds code from chosen classes, has integrated DLL support. and custom functions to help with that hit of preformance.

 * **2.** **Simplicity** FlexiKit was designed to be a very powerful library while being easy to write. When testing how quick it is to prototype with FlexiKit we managed to get a GUI screen in 5 lines.

 * **3.** **Less Error-Prone** FlexiKit does all the headaches for you. No need to re-invent the wheel with some library that makes **YOU** do all the work. When using the UI import with FlexiKit, why write 30 lines to have a error prone GUI? With FlexiKit write a GUI screen in 5 lines and have ZERO errors!

 * **4.** **Low Level Written In C++** All FlexiKit dll's are written in raw C++ and compiled to dll format for maximum preformance and ease of use in python functions.
